<h1>The JavaScript Dojo âœ¨</h1>

This repo is for JavaScript problem solving practice during the 2019 General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive ðŸ’ªðŸ”¥The goal of this is to understand the nuances of JavaScript problem solving, gain a deeper understanding of this super cool language, and **explain solutions to anyone regardless of technical background** ðŸ’• 

The latter the most important goal because not only it exemplify understanding of these concepts, it also makes computer science more inclusive for all!

## Problems and Solutions
Problems will come from various sites like CodeWars, LeetCode, Hackerrank, and GeeksForGeeks. Each solution will describe the approach thoroughly and discuss tradeoffs and runtime. 

### Example Solution Discussion 
```js
/**
 * @param {string[]} words the word array to convert to morse
 * @return {number} the length of unique morse representations
 */
const uniqueMorseRepresentations = words => {  
    // The Alggorithm is as follows: 

    // 1. We split the characters of each word with our first use of map
    // 2. Inside our outer map method, we map each letter to a morse rep
    // 3. We attach each morse letter to create one word

    // When step 3 is finished, we add the word to the set. The spread operator 
    // is used to create an array with the set entires and return the length. 

    // The lookup time for an array's length will be faster than using the Set.prototype.size
    // as this is a function which counts the unique elements.
    // Array.length is however updated after each addition of a new element.

    // SEE: https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-array.prototype.push Step 11.
    // SEE: https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-get-set.prototype.size
    return [...new Set(words.map(word => word.split('').map(letter => alphabet[letter]).join('')))].length
}
```

Feedback and discussions are always welcome! Thank you for joining me on this JavaScript journey!
